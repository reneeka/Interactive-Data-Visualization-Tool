This project is co-owned by: [@reneeka](https://www.github.com/reneeka) [@chahelgupta](https://www.github.com/chahelgupta) [@amishidesai](https://www.github.com/AmishiDesai04) 

## Overview
The JavaFX project aims to build an interactive data visualization tool offering Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, and Line Graphs. Users can input data for each chart type, customize visual aspects like colors and labels, and interact with zooming and tooltips. The project focuses on providing a user-friendly experience, robust data validation, and comprehensive documentation.

## Scope of the Project
1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Create a user-friendly UI using JavaFX with options for Pie Chart, Bar Graph, and Line Graph.
   - Implement navigation between different chart options and back to the main menu.
   - Include input fields or dialogs for users to input their data points for visualization.

2. **Chart Types:**
   - **Pie Chart:**
     - Allow users to input data values and labels for creating a Pie Chart.
     - Display the Pie Chart with interactive features such as tooltips showing data labels and values.
   - **Bar Graph:**
     - Provide options for users to input data names/numbers and their frequencies to create a Bar Graph.
     - Display the Bar Graph with labeled axes and appropriate scaling based on the data.
   - **Line Graph:**
     - Allow users to input data points with X and Y coordinates to create a Line Graph.
     - Display the Line Graph with labeled axes and markers connecting data points.

3. **Data Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure it is in the correct format for each chart type.
   - Handle data input errors and display appropriate error messages to users.

4. **Chart Customization:**
   - Provide options for users to customize the appearance of the charts, such as colors, legends, titles, axis labels, etc.

5. **Interactivity:**
   - Implement interactive features such as zooming, panning, and tooltips to enhance the user experience.
   - Enable users to save the generated charts as images or export data for further analysis.

## Project Synopsis
The interactive data visualization tool developed using JavaFX offers a comprehensive solution for users to analyze and present their data effectively. With a focus on user experience, the tool provides a range of chart options including Pie Charts for categorical data, Bar Graphs for frequency distribution, and Line Graphs for trend analysis over time. Users can input their data directly into the tool, customize the appearance of charts with colors, labels, and legends, and explore interactive features such as zooming and tooltips for in-depth analysis.

## Implementation
The project consists of three main components:
1. **MainScreen:** Implements the main menu screen with options for different chart types and navigation between them.
2. **Pie Chart:** Allows users to input data and generates a Pie Chart with interactive features.
3. **Bar Graph:** Enables users to input data and creates a Bar Graph with labeled axes.
4. **Line Graph:** Allows users to input data points and generates a Line Graph with markers connecting data points.

## Conclusion
The JavaFX project represents a significant step towards simplifying data analysis and visualization, enhancing productivity, and fostering data-driven decision-making processes. By providing users with the ability to create and customize various types of charts, the tool empowers them to gain valuable insights from their data with ease.
